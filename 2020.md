- Community Notes

What’s the process for moving forward with a proposed plugin? 

- Initial planning

The Ionic team is looking for feedback from the community on what plugins should be added. While still validating the process, we’d ideally like to get feedback from the existing community members on what plugins are good and where to invest time in.

  - Validate plugins that have an existing third-party plugin
  - If plugin is in working condition, extend invitation to join community org (reach out to ionic member about inviting)

- Core Team Notes 

- Working on V3 is underway
- Plugins being split out into separate packages
- Some new plugins built off Ionic Components 
- Supporting community driven platforms (electron)
